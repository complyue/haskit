# HaskIt - Haskell software, fast Iterations

[Haskell](https://haskell.org)
makes the wrong stuff harder to build, if not the right
things easier to form.

Programming in **Haskell**, it is actually harder, for you to progress,
before you come (back, likely at times, with your love) with a sufficient
understanding of your problem,
[in mathematical ways](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07968),
this is one of the reasons why **Haskell** software usually bear high
quality and the language is so great.

At times, you just can **not** gain understandings of that grade, without
trials, i.e. experiments with your data and workflows for currently
running business, that might include your users and even your suppliers.

And that normally involve some pieces of software powering the run of
your trials. With respect to programming languages, there you have plenty,
practical choices:

- boring **Haskell** for true love
- **Rust**, **C/C++** for raw machine performance
- **Python**, **Ruby** for fast iterations
- **Julia** for both above
- **Go** for collaboration between commponents
- **JavaScript** for Web technology based UI, and everything else with extra love
- many others in the mix

But why not start benefitting from **Haskell**, before you feel comfortable
to use it directly, if you have the choice?

Here is this offer:

- **HaskIt** (this package)

  Interactive workbench with easy yet powerful visualizations, for data/idea
  exploration.

- [Đ (Edh)](https://github.com/e-wrks/edh)

  An **Object** layer (or otherwise a parasitic programming language)
  powered by **Haskell** ([GHC](https://haskell.org/ghc)), especially
  [Software Transactional Memory](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm).

- [HasDB](https://github.com/e-wrks/hasdb)

  A
  [DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system)
  that manages
  [in-memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-memory_database)
  [Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database)s
  those manifesting
  [out-of-core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-core)
  [Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_DBMS)s
  .

  - [HasPyC](https://github.com/e-wrks/haspyc)

    The **Python** connector to **HasDB**, to integrate with your numeric
    systems, bound to high-dimensional data (e.g. parameters of machine
    learning models, training data, time-seriesÎ), modeled after
    **Entity-Relationship** as **Graph**s, i.e. entities as nodes and
    relationships as edges.

- [Sedh](https://github.com/e-wrks/sedh)

  Manage your swarms of servers.

  Think of even easier parallelism in spirit of
  [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org)

- [Nedh](https://github.com/e-wrks/nedh)

  Yet another abstraction of networking.

  Think of something like **TCP** services with **UDP** discoveries.
