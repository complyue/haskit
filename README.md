# HaskIt - Haskell software, fast Iterations

[Haskell](https://haskell.org)
makes the wrong stuff harder to build, if not the right
things easier to form.

Programming in **Haskell**, it is actually harder, for you to progress,
before you come (back, likely at times, with your love) with a sufficient
understanding of your problem,
[in mathematical ways](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07968),
this is one of the reasons why **Haskell** software usually bear high
quality and the language is so great.

At times, you just can **not** gain understandings of that grade, without
trials, i.e. experiments with your data and workflows for currently
running business, that might include your users and even your suppliers.

And that normally involve some pieces of software powering the run of
your trials. With respect to programming languages, there you have plenty,
practical choices:

- boring **Haskell** for true love
- **C/C++** for raw machine performance
- **Python** for fast iterations
- **Julia** for both above
- **Go** for collaboration between commponents
- **JavaScript** for Web technology based UI, and even backend stuffs with extra love
- many others in the mix

But why not start benefitting from **Haskell**, before you can use it
directly, if you have the choice?

Here is this offer:

- [ƒê (Edh)](https://github.com/e-wrks/edh)
  An **Object** layer (or otherwise a parasitic programming language)
  atop **Haskell** (GHC)

- [HasDB](https://github.com/e-wrks/hasdb)
  A
  [DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system)
  that manages
  [in-memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-memory_database)
  [Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database)s
  those manifesting
  [out-of-core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-core)
  [Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_DBMS)s
  .

  Integrate with your numeric systems with persistent high-dimensional
  data (parameters of machine learning models, training data etc.), with
  [HasPyC](https://github.com/e-wrks/haspyc)
  the Python connector to **HasDB**

- [Sedh](https://github.com/e-wrks/sedh)
  Manage your swarm of servers

  Think of [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) made even easier.

- [Nedh](https://github.com/e-wrks/nedh)
  Low level networking support
