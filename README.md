# HaskIt - Haskell software, fast Iterations

Programming in **Haskell**, it's actually harder for you to progress
before coming (back, likely at times) with a sufficient understanding
of your problem in mathematical ways, this is one of the reasons why
**Haskell** software usually bear with high quality and the language
is so great.

At times, you just can not gain understandings of that grade, without
trials, i.e. experiments with your data and workflows, that might
include your users and even your suppliers, and that normally invole
some software powering the run of your trial business.

You have plenty, practical choices besides **Haskell**

- **C/C++** for raw machine performance
- **Python** for fast iterations
- **Julia** for both above
- **Go** for collaboration between commponents
- **JavaScript** for Web technology based UI, and even backend stuffs with extra love

But why not start benefitting from **Haskell** before your can use it
by yourself, if you have the choice?
